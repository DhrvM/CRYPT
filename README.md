# CRYPT: Campus Rust-Yielded Protected Transmission

CRYPT is an encrypted chat application designed exclusively for students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). It provides a secure and private communication platform based on a terminal window interface.

## Technical Overview
- Backend: Rust-based server using Tokio, Actix web framework, PostgreSQL with Diesel ORM, JWT authentication, and Serde for serialization. (checkpoint 1)
- Frontend: Terminal UI using Ratatui, HTTP requests, and WebSocket for real-time messaging. (checkpoint 2)
- Deployment: CI/CD pipeline, and deployment on a cloud platform. (checkpoint 2)

## Possible Challenges
- Learning curve for Rust and its libraries (Tokio, Actix, Yew, Diesel).
- Implementing secure encryption algorithms and key management.
- Handling real-time communication and scaling for a large number of users.
- Designing an intuitive and responsive UI/UX.
- Integrating with UIUC authentication system securely.
